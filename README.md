Developed a feature-rich NotesApp using Next.js, incorporating authentication options through Google, GitHub, and Discord. Leveraging the T3 stack with Supabase as the database, the app offers a seamless and secure user experience. Utilizing TypeScript, TRPC, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS, I ensured a robust and efficient codebase. The app enables users to create notes using Markdown, with a custom Markdown editor implemented through CodeMirror and React-Markdown. Additionally, users can add tags to categorize their notes, promoting better organization and accessibility.
